Hello, I'm an incoming Stanford Masters of Computer Science student.

My areas of interest are representation learning, information retrieval, dialogue research and text generation with Large Language Models.

Before coming to Stanford, I have experience in Alexa, AWS AI teams.

I personally organize a weekly NLP study group for Korean industry professionals and upcoming researchers.
