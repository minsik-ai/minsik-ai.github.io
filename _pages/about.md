Hello! I'm a Machine Learning Engineer from Amazon, with tenure in Alexa, AWS AI teams.

My areas of interest are representation learning, dialogue research and text generation with LLMs (Large Language Models).

I personally organize an NLP study group for industry professionals and upcoming researchers, called NLP Tea Time.
Please feel free to shoot an email if you'd like to join! (Korean)
